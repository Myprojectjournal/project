    <h1>THE PURIFIED CHURCH</h1>
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>Christ’s Return</h2>
    <p>Jesus Christ is coming back. It is the assignment of the five-fold ministry to build and mature the body as we await His coming.</p>
    <p>The way the Lord purifies His bride is by <strong>commending the Church</strong> and also <strong>correcting the areas that need adjustment</strong>.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>Balance in Building:</strong>  
      To build mature believers, we must be lavish in both <em>commendation</em> and <em>correction</em>.  
      - Only commending = weak people.  
      - Only correcting = discouraged people.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>7 Sins That Must Be Stopped</h2>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>1. Sexual Immorality & Related Perversions</h3>
      <p>The desire for intimacy is not demonic. It is God-given, but must be expressed within God’s conditions. Lust and immorality pervert this desire to man’s destruction.</p>
      <h4>5 Steps to Overcome:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Admit it honestly.</li>
        <li>Set aside time for personal retreat (Psalm 51).</li>
        <li>Where it persists, seek help.</li>
        <li>Create rules and boundaries in life.</li>
        <li>Connect to a larger family of believers.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>2. Lust for Money & Material Things</h3>
      <p>Materialism is not about owning things, but when things own you. God wants to bless us, but not with hearts attached to money.</p>
      <p><strong>First law of wealth:</strong> absolute surrender. Until you die to self and fully yield to God, you are only bargaining with Him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>3. Witchcraft & Extra-Biblical Practices</h3>
      <p>We must be delivered from manipulation, sorcery, and false practices (Ezekiel 13).</p>
      <h4>Three Types of People in the Kingdom:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pure breeds:</strong> Pure in heart, love God, avoid evil.</li>
        <li><strong>Innocent but misled:</strong> Sincere but diverted by bad mentorship and wrong friends.</li>
        <li><strong>From inception not of God:</strong> Evil at heart, committed to deception and demonic works.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The cure to witchcraft and manipulation is <strong>the fear of God</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>4. Pride, Vain Glory & Self-Centeredness</h3>
      <p>Pride downplays others and makes everything about “me.” God condemns pride and self-centeredness.</p>
      <p>John said: <em>“A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven… He must increase, but I must decrease.”</em></p>
      <p>There is a difference between <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>humility</strong>. One can be simple yet still prideful.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>5. The Sin of the Tongue</h3>
      <p>Keep your tongue from evil and lies. The Lord hates these six things (Proverbs 6):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A proud look</li>
        <li>A lying tongue</li>
        <li>Hands that shed innocent blood</li>
        <li>A heart devising wicked imaginations</li>
        <li>Feet swift to mischief</li>
        <li>A false witness speaking lies</li>
        <li>One who sows discord among brethren</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>6. Competition & Unhealthy Comparison</h3>
      <p>Competition is a dangerous spirit. The Bible says those who compare themselves with others are not wise.</p>
      <p>If we think we are the only ones making impact, we deceive ourselves and insult the Holy Spirit who works through many bodies in Christ.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="sin">
      <h3>7. The Sin of Imbalance</h3>
      <p>Extremes and imbalance in doctrine or practice harm the body of Christ. Truth must always be balanced with love, humility, and wisdom.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="highlight">
      <p><strong>The purified Church</strong> is the bride prepared for Christ’s return: holy, humble, balanced, and rooted in truth.</p>
