      <h2>INSTRUCTIONS FROM GOD</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>You must build a consistent prayer life.</strong><br>
          <em>Mark 11:24, Philippians 4:6–8, Matthew 7:7–8</em><br>
          Prayer is our safety net. We must build an intentional and consistent life of prayer.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>You must submit to and live by the Word of God.</strong><br>
          <em>Matthew 4:4, Acts 20:32, Acts 6:4, 1 Timothy 4:13, John 1:1–4</em><br>
          Don’t submit selectively; some people only follow the parts that align with their beliefs. But man shall live by every word that comes from the mouth of God.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Deliberately fight the “know it all” mentality by continuous learning.</strong><br>
          <em>1 Corinthians 8:2</em><br>
          If anyone thinks he knows anything, he knows nothing yet as he ought to.  
          Everything in life is a teacher: other people’s mistakes can be a lesson to the wise.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Never despise the abilities, giftings, and spiritual resources given to you by God.</strong><br>
          <em>1 Timothy 4:14</em><br>
          Gifts must be discovered, refined, and deployed. They will open doors and create room for you.  
          Whether physical, spiritual, or intellectual, they were given for the profiting of yourself and others.  
          Serve with humility, grace, and excellence.  
          <br><em>Focus on impact beyond fame.</em> (Luke 2:38 – Hannah the prophetess)
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Invest in building strategic destiny relationships.</strong><br>
          <em>Psalm 115:1</em><br>
          Relationships are bridges to an exceptional life. Burn bridges carelessly and you may never reach your destiny.  
          May you never be so poor that all you have is money.  
          Four types of destiny helpers you will need in a lifetime:  
          <ul>
            <li>Divine connectors</li>
            <li>Men and women of influence (<em>Proverbs 16:7</em>)</li>
            <li>Gifted men</li>
            <li>Burden bearers</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>In addition to being spiritual, seek to impact your world positively.</strong><br>
          <em>Acts 8</em><br>
          Impact starts with one person at a time: first yourself, then your family, then society.  
          Change yourself → change your family → change your world.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Think Posterity.</strong><br>
          Leave a godly inheritance:  
          <ul>
            <li>Spiritual convictions</li>
            <li>Leverage of relationships</li>
            <li>And more — treasures that outlive you</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
