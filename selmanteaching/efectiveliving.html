    <h2>Key Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Destiny:</strong> The preordained path that has been made for you; God’s expected end for your life.</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The reason or motivation for which something exists; the role a person or thing has to play in God’s grand plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Potential:</strong> Inherent abilities capable of being developed and refined to one’s advantage.</li>
      <li><strong>Fulfillment:</strong> The satisfaction of achieving goals and knowing you lived effectively, serving God’s purposes and blessing humanity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The First Motivation for All Human Behavior</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The need for security.</li>
      <li>The need for variety or newness.</li>
      <li>The need for significance.</li>
      <li>The need for love and acceptance.</li>
      <li>The need for growth.</li>
      <li>The desire for impact and contribution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Five Questions for a Life of Fulfillment</h2>
    <p>Anyone who desires to live effectively must ask and answer these questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Who am I?</strong>  
        Know your identity—it must be derived from the Word.  
        Even if you fail, you are not a failure.  
        As believers, our identity is rooted in Christ.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Where am I from?</strong>  
        Understand that all men come from God.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What do I have?</strong>  
        No man is without the investment of the Spirit of God.  
        There is something in your <em>house</em> and something in your <em>hand</em>—these are keys to your relevance.  
        We must surrender them to the Lord.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Why am I here?</strong>  
        <ul>
          <li>To fulfill the <strong>Great Commission</strong>.</li>
          <li>To carry out our <strong>unique assignment</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What can I do?</strong>  
        Potential must be discovered, appreciated, and deployed.  
        Crude potential cannot serve or receive reward—it must be refined.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Where am I going?</strong>  
        At the end, we must define what we call “home.”  
        If our hope is only in this life, then we have lived miserably.  
        We live because Jesus is alive in us—He is the way, the truth, and the life.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="highlight">
      You begin to live effectively not when you get a job or build a house,  
      but the day you <strong>submit to Jesus</strong>.  
      Submission to religion or church is not enough—true life begins in Christ.
    </div>

    <h2>Purpose vs. Ambition</h2>
    <p>
      There is an emptiness inside every man without Jesus.  
      True effective living is when all you do brings glory to Him—whether in singing, business, or service.  
      <strong>Ambition</strong> leads to self-glorification,  
      but <strong>purpose</strong> leads to glorifying Jesus.
