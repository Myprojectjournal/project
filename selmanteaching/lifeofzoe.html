    <h1>ZOE LIFE: THE THEOLOGY OF LIFE</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>John tells us that from a spiritual standpoint there are two kinds of birth. The Bible says you can be born of blood and the will of man, contrasted against being born of God.</p>

    <h2>Two Kinds of Birth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Physical / Natural / Biological Birth</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Rebirth / Spiritual Birth</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jesus said, “That which is born of flesh is flesh, but that which is born of Spirit is spirit.”</p>

    <h2>Natural Birth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Our will is not part of the equation—we were not given liberty to choose.</li>
      <li>Requires both man and woman.</li>
      <li>Requires <span class="highlight">time (9 months)</span>.</li>
      <li>Has a validity period: the lifetime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Spiritual Birth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Our will decides—we choose to be born again.</li>
      <li>Happens instantly by the hearing of faith.</li>
      <li>Does not require man and woman—just God’s Word and Spirit.</li>
      <li>The official gateway to <strong>Zoe life</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="scripture">“All things were created by Him; without Him was not anything made that was made.” — John 1:3</div>

    <h2>Three Kinds of Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bios</strong>: Physical life.</li>
      <li><strong>Psuché</strong>: Soulical life (Matthew 15:25).</li>
      <li><strong>Zoe</strong>: The God-kind of life — supernatural, uncreated, indestructible, eternal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Does It Mean to Be Born Again?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Born of God</strong> — Restored to the Father as the prodigal son was restored.</li>
      <li><strong>Born of the Spirit</strong> — Receive the characteristics of the Spirit, manifest supernatural qualities like wisdom, kindness, joy.</li>
      <li><strong>Born of the Word</strong> — The incorruptible seed of God’s Word (1 Peter 1:23).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Three Gifts at Salvation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Forgiveness of sin.</li>
      <li>Gift of righteousness.</li>
      <li>The life of God (Zoe).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implications of Having Zoe</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Oneness with Christ</strong> — Like husband and wife becoming one (Ephesians 2).</li>
      <li><strong>Positional Advantage</strong> — Elevated above principalities and powers.</li>
      <li><strong>Access to His Name</strong> — Authority through conscious use of the name of Jesus (Colossians 3:17).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Finished Reality vs Manifest Reality</h2>
    <p>Realities are finished in Christ (prophetic realities) but must manifest in our lives. The prayer is: “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” (Matthew 6:10)</p>

    <div class="scripture">“Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for He is faithful that promised.” — Hebrews 10:23</div>

    <h2>The Journey of Zoe</h2>
    <p>When you receive Christ, it is your spirit that receives salvation. Your soul and body must go through a gradual process called the <span class="highlight">renewal of the mind</span>. The Spirit of God, partnered with your obedience, determines the pace of this transformation.</p>

    <p><strong>The first law of liberty</strong> is acknowledging what is finished in Christ, even before manifestation. Faith comes by hearing—even your own declarations build faith.</p>
