        “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is the foundation of understanding.” 
        (Proverbs 9:10)
      </p>
      <p>
        The people that know their God shall be strong and do exploits. 
        What makes a person fruitful in God’s Kingdom is not how long they attend church 
        or how long they pray, but the depth of their <strong>encounter with God</strong>.

      <h2>Implications of Knowing God</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>God wants to be known.</strong></li>
        <li>
          You are not permitted to use your own methods to know God. 
          If you try to create your own route, you may encounter spirits but not God. 
          The first law of encounter is <em>submission</em>. 
          The faster you give up on your own strength, the deeper your encounter.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are instructions you cannot obey until you’ve had an encounter, 
          because the strength to obey comes from the encounter itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can doubt what you <em>hear</em>, but you cannot doubt what you <em>see</em>. 
          A genuine encounter changes your speech and your life.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The greatest revelation of God comes through His <strong>nature</strong> and <strong>character</strong>.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Three Ways to Learn God</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>By studying His <strong>character and nature</strong>.</li>
        <li>By studying His <strong>ways</strong>.</li>
        <li>By studying His <strong>power</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <strong>ways of God</strong> translate into wisdom. 
        His <strong>nature and character</strong> reveal His heart.

      <h2>Why Jesus Came</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To correct our understanding of God.</li>
        <li>To bring reconciliation and restore our connection to God.</li>
        <li>To become our pattern man—the hope of our calling.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="highlight">
        “I will make all my goodness pass before you…” – Exodus 33:19
      </p>
      <p>
        The goodness of God is an expression of His glory. Jesus said, “Only God is good.” 
        Unlike men who are inconsistent, God’s nature is everlasting and unchanging (Psalm 103).

      <h2>Four Principal Qualities of God’s Nature</h2>

      <h3>1. God is Spirit (John 4:24)</h3>
      <p>
        To walk with God, you must move beyond the flesh and into the realm of the Spirit. 
        Worship and spiritual dealings require a spirit-oriented life. 
        God’s ways are unusual, and only those who walk in the Spirit can truly know Him.
      </p>

      <h3>2. God is Holy</h3>
      <p>
        He is King of kings seated on the throne. Holiness gives us confidence against evil spirits 
        and principalities. “Holy” means “only” – set apart, unique. 
        True worship is not singing but living a consistent life of interaction with God 
        until it becomes a lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p class="highlight">
        “The knowledge of the Holy is understanding.”
      </p>

      <h3>3. God is Light</h3>
      <p>
        “The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord.” God doesn’t just bring light into darkness; 
        He can command light out of darkness. What makes things manifest is light (Ephesians 3). 
        Pray for grace to see His light.
      </p>

      <h3>4. God is Love</h3>
      <p>God’s love has four dimensions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Passion:</strong> A hunger for God. When appetite fades, love is being compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> Staying with God even in troubles and inconveniences. Love is not mere emotion but endurance.</li>
        <li><strong>Pleasure:</strong> There are benefits and joy in serving God.</li>
        <li><strong>Sacrifice:</strong> The highest form of love—Agape.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h2>Two Results of Knowing God</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidence and freedom from fear.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment to imitate God:</strong> If He heals, you will heal; if He delivers, you will deliver.</li>
      </ul>
