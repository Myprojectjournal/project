    <p>
      The Zoe Life grants us the possibility and capacity to live like God and function like God.
    </p>

    <h2>What does it mean to live like God?</h2>
    <p>It means to manifest the character of God even though we are trapped in human form.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      There is a difference between a <strong>Living Soul</strong> and a <strong>Life-Giving Spirit</strong>.  
      A living soul only enjoys the life given to him; he cannot transmit it to anybody.  
      But a life-giving spirit can extend what he carries.  
      This is what Jesus meant when He said: <em>“Out of your belly shall flow rivers of living water.”</em>
    </div>

    <p>
      If you want to understand the character of God, study <strong>demon possession</strong>.  
      The first ability given to man is <strong>power to become</strong>, not just power against.  
      Our spirit-to-spirit salvation must sink into the <strong>soulical realm</strong> (mind, will, emotions).  
      The body is just an instrument of execution—it obeys whatever “software” is written in the soul.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The Bible says: <strong>“You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</strong>  
      Sometimes it is not a spirit holding you captive but your own understanding.
    </div>

    <h2>What does it mean to manifest and live like Christ?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It means to rise above sin and the flesh.</li>
      <li>It means to manifest the fruit of the Spirit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Seven things Jesus delivered us from:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sin</li>
      <li>Flesh</li>
      <li>World</li>
      <li>Death</li>
      <li>Grave</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The <strong>sin problem</strong> is solved immediately after salvation,  
      but the <strong>flesh problem</strong> is not solved immediately.  
      Freedom is not endurance—true liberty comes by understanding the <em>law of liberty</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>The First Laws to Live Like Christ</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You must believe that the power to overcome sin and flesh is already within you.</li>
      <li>Romans 6:11 – “Reckon yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus.”</li>
      <li>Hold fast your profession of faith regardless of circumstances.</li>
      <li>Yield your members (body) to decisions that reflect Christ-like living.  
          The power to honor decisions comes from God.</li>
      <li>Engage in spiritual activities that strengthen your spirit:
        <ul>
          <li>Prayer</li>
          <li>Listening to the Word</li>
          <li>Church fellowship and activities</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>The Fruit of the Holy Spirit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Love:</strong> When you don’t have an answer, say “God is greater.”</li>
      <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> The Holy Spirit is our comforter.</li>
      <li><strong>Wisdom:</strong> Extraordinary wisdom to function like God.</li>
      <li><strong>Creativity & Innovation:</strong> Always say “God show me the way,” because there is always a way.</li>
      <li><strong>Excellence:</strong> To reflect God’s order and beauty.</li>
      <li><strong>Wealth:</strong> Wealth is a response to value, not love of money. True servants of God should not beg.</li>
      <li><strong>Mighty Works:</strong> The fruit of wisdom manifested in power.</li>
      <li><strong>Life:</strong> Every spiritual man functioning like God becomes a life-giving spirit.</li>
    </ul>
