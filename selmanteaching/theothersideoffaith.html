    <h1>THE OTHER SIDE OF FAITH</h1>
    <p>Apostle Joshua Selman | Galatians 1:24, John 17:1</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Our walk with God and exploits in this Kingdom require the power of the Spirit. 
      When the bride (the Church) and the Spirit become one, true manifestation happens.
    </p>

    <h2>Faith in the Scriptures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Hebrews 11:</b> Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen.</li>
      <li><b>John 1:3:</b> All things were made by Him; without Him was not anything made that was made.</li>
      <li><b>Hebrews 2:4:</b> God also bearing witness with signs, wonders, and diverse miracles.</li>
      <li><b>Romans 1:17:</b> The just shall live by faith.</li>
      <li><b>Habakkuk 2:4:</b> The just shall live by his faith.</li>
      <li><b>Galatians 3:7:</b> They which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Men With Good Report in Heaven</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Abel:</b> Obtained witness that he was righteous by offering an excellent sacrifice.</li>
      <li><b>Enoch:</b> Had the testimony that he pleased God, and was translated without seeing death.</li>
      <li><b>Noah:</b> By faith built an ark to the saving of his household, becoming heir of righteousness.</li>
      <li><b>Abraham:</b> By faith obeyed and went out, looking for a city with foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</li>
      <li><b>Job 42:10:</b> The Lord turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends, and gave him twice as much as before.</li>
    </ul>

      "Faith is not just believing God for things, it is living in alignment with Godâ€™s Word until His will manifests in your life."
