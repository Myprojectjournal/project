        “A man who rejects the Word of God has rejected everything God is offering. 
        The foundation of an excelling life is your relationship with God.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God. 
        When you pursue anything higher than your relationship with God, 
        you lose all the benefits of becoming an exceptional person.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is God that makes men prosper. Spiritually, He is the foundation of true dominion and exploits in the Kingdom.
        God does not respond to men emotionally. There are rules of engagement:
        God is moved by His Word. He is touched by our infirmities, but He responds to His Word.

      <h2>Four (Plus One) Models of Prayer</h2>

      <h3>1. Praying in the Spirit</h3>
      <p>
        This means praying in tongues—the gift of the Spirit that empowers believers and blesses the Church. 
        When you pray in the Spirit, it may sound like gibberish, but you are yielding to the Holy Spirit 
        to pray the will of God through you. It is not just a ritual—it is divine intercession.
      </p>
      <p><strong>3 things that happen when you pray in tongues:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You build power within yourself.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit reveals the knowledge of God’s will to you.</li>
        <li>You allow the Spirit to align your life with God’s wisdom and plan.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Declaring Scriptures in Prayer</h3>
      <p>
        Prayer is powerful when it is rooted in the Word of God. Declaring Scripture is a way to align 
        your petitions with God’s eternal truth, ensuring your prayers have divine backing.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Prayer of Enquiry</h3>
      <p>
        Before making decisions, pray and ask God for direction. 
        What looks good to man may not be God’s will. 
        Even good people or friends can unknowingly be used by Satan to mislead us. 
        Remember, Satan tempted Jesus using Scripture (“It is written…”).
      </p>

      <h3>4. Warfare Prayer</h3>
      <p>
        Life is a battleground. Warfare prayer is engaging spiritual weapons 
        to enforce God’s will against the powers of darkness. 
        <span class="highlight">“All things work together for the good of those who love God.” (Romans 8:28)</span>
      </p>

      <h3>5. The Prayer of Thanksgiving</h3>
      <p>
        Gratitude keeps your heart humble and your spirit open to God. 
        Thanksgiving acknowledges God as your Source and sustains your victories in life.
