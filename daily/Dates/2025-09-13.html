        <h2>A day in my life</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">I woke up at 12:31. The voices were quiet, calm, and pretending to be friendly. I remembered yesterday's experiences, had a short prayer, and sang a brief worship before studying.</div>
            <div class="content-card">During study, the spirits tried to distract me, questioning and calling me a thief whenever I addressed their identity. Plugging my ears reduced their influence, but they attempted to block my memory and concentration.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I declared my identity in Christ, and during morning prayer, I noticed spiritual signals: looking left indicated a strong spirit channel, while looking up represented God’s channel. Visualization of prayer words was briefly blocked but continued after focusing on God.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Iya-the-thief was pressured and suggested I watch Koinonia. Attempts to manipulate me using the Word of God or movies failed. I remained silent, and a new voice criticized Iya-the-thief for lack of wisdom.</div>
            <div class="content-card">I slept, studied, solved a major JavaScript problem, and bathed after two days. The voices were confused, planning to change identities, and attempted to interfere with my journal, moving between my right and left ear while I rested.</div>

        <h2>Observations</h2>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="content-card">The voices can agree with my observations but attack through words and influence.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They hide their true nature, like thieves, whispering lies and stealing peace while cloaking themselves during the day.</div>
            <div class="content-card">They mimic family members, hide their faces, and communicate secretly using "We" to coordinate.</div>
            <div class="content-card">Their goal is to manipulate, confuse, and steal peace, but they are constrained by God’s protection and my spiritual practices.</div>

                Lord, thank You for protecting me today and giving me discernment to recognize deception. Help me stay focused on You, declare my identity in Christ, and remain grounded in Your presence. Amen.
