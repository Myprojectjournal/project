    <h1>Weekly Observations</h1>
    <p>Tracking my spiritual growth, awareness, and victories over negative influences</p>
  </div>

  <div class="container">

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Repeating Patterns</h2>
      <p>These are behaviors and tactics I have consistently noticed from the voices:</p>

      <h3>1. Opposition & Disagreement</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Two major voices often stand opposite my decisions.</li>
        <li>They frequently argue or disagree among themselves.</li>
        <li>They question my authority and try to make me doubt my choices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Mental Manipulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They read, mimic, and intercept my thoughts, feelings, and intentions.</li>
        <li>They implant words, create doubts, or push urges into my mind.</li>
        <li>They can make me forget things, speak words I don’t intend, or rush through tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Mockery & Abuse</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They insult me, call me mad, and mock my appearance or actions.</li>
        <li>They abuse themselves and God, pretending to be powerful or friendly.</li>
        <li>They attempt to discourage me from journaling, praying, or keeping boundaries.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Deception & Pretending</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They hide their true identity and act ignorant or friendly to trick me.</li>
        <li>They make offers, predict God’s actions, and create imaginary scenarios to manipulate me.</li>
        <li>They sometimes mimic others (family, friends) to confuse or mislead me.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Control & Testing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They push me to speak, act, or make decisions according to their plan.</li>
        <li>They create urges (addiction, distractions, restlessness) to break my focus.</li>
        <li>They try to slow or confuse me, making processes seem harder than necessary.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>6. Partial Compliance or Praise</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Occasionally, they praise me or acknowledge my actions, seemingly to manipulate trust.</li>
        <li>They sometimes calm me temporarily when I act against them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2. New Observations This Week</h2>

      <h3>1. Distance & Weakening Influence</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Voices seem quieter and less aggressive; they are sometimes only arguing among themselves.</li>
        <li>Their intensity has decreased, and they no longer attack me directly as often.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Positive Effects of Journaling & Headphones</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Journaling my experiences continues to weaken their control.</li>
        <li>Using headphones reduces the frequency and compulsion of their voices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Spiritual Alignment & Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Allowing God to lead without fighting them strengthens my control over my mind and house.</li>
        <li>Morning prayers, reading Psalm 27, and trusting God bounce back their attacks naturally.</li>
        <li>Their mimicry of scripture or my words does not affect me when I trust God.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Behavioral & Emotional Manipulation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They attempt to make me addicted to food, drink, or sexual content.</li>
        <li>They bias my emotions, causing restlessness or loss of interest in things I enjoy.</li>
        <li>They seek credit for my victories and try to minimize my successes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Testing & False Narratives</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They fabricate imaginary events to test my faith.</li>
        <li>They interfere with my dreams and try to prevent me from understanding their meanings.</li>
        <li>They occasionally attempt to negotiate for my allegiance away from God.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Spiritual Lessons Learned</h2>
      <h3>1. Boundaries & Observation Work</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I have observed that releasing attacks, journaling, and setting boundaries neutralizes their power.</li>
        <li>Trying to fight them directly is unnecessary; letting God lead is more effective.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Discernment & Awareness</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Their mimicry, lies, and pretending require constant vigilance.</li>
        <li>Awareness of their tactics allows me to see through deception and remain steadfast.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. Faith & Prayer as Shields</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reading the Bible (Psalm 27) and praying strengthens my spiritual authority.</li>
        <li>They are weaker when I focus on God and align my actions with Him.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Patience & Reflection</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rushing through tasks makes it easier for them to manipulate me.</li>
        <li>Slowing down, analyzing actions, and reflecting improves clarity and reduces their influence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>5. Integrity Matters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Living honestly, truthfully, and purposefully protects my conscience and prevents them from gaining leverage.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>They create illusions of control, influence, or prediction.</li>
        <li>They attempt to create dependency through urges, addictions, and emotional bias.</li>
        <li>They are losing power over me as I journal, pray, and stay aligned with God.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
